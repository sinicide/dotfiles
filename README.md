# Huy Nguyen's dotfiles
Dotfiles, it's all the rage! This is my take on dotfiles configuration for my own personal use.

## problem
So why dotfiles? At home and work, I use a varierty of platforms and wanted a way to get going on various platforms, RedHat/Centos, Ubuntu, and Cygwin.

## solution
I use bash, I like bash, it's enough for me and so I wanted to make sure I had some consistencies when I use it on Linux and Cygwin.

## install
```
git clone https://github.com/sinicide/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
